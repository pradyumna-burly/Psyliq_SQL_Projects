# [Project 1: Pharma Data Analysis using SQL](https://github.com/pradyumna-burly/SQL-Project-Pharma_Data_Analysis)

As an intern at Psyliq, my project involves analyzing sales data from a pharmaceutical company. I utilized MS Excel for data cleaning and SQL for querying specific questions. The dataset comprises distributor and customer details, sales channels, product information, quantities, prices, and sales figures. Through this analysis, I aim to uncover meaningful insights by leveraging SQL.
